Bank to Ledger .dat
===================

Converts a bank's export to a Ledger compatible .dat.

**Does not work!!**

It should be in 2 parts. 1 part parses out the bank's export into objects and outputs them. The second part should be able to convert a transaction comment into an appropriate account name. Eg. "SOMETHING PAYPAL SOMETHING" => Expenses:Paypal.
